        <h1>Required Texts</h1><!-- Highest Level Heading.. Main Section

Whenever you added a heading element, it will add line break to the contents and will bring the current cursor position to the new line section-->
        <h4>TextBook</h4> <!-- This is subsection part -->
        <!-- The following section is going to have two paragraphs. To view them properly, we need to use a seperator. We can do this in two ways: we can either use line break tag/element or we can use paragraph tag, <p>. inbetween the opening and closing paragraph tag, we can put all of the contents of that paragraph-->
        
        <p>
            <b>No specific book</b> is recommended. The student can use any related textbook for learning the
materials. <!-- <b> represents bold content .. instead of <b> we can use <strong> tag as well-->
        </p>
        
        <p>
        There are some valuable textbooks available for learning HTML. But a problem to those books is HTML changes very frequently. Once a new change is brought, the old book contents get obsolete. So, we always need to be updated by searching for new contents in Internet.
        </p>

        <h4>Online Resources</h4>
        All the <em><b>class recordings<sup>1</sup>, required documentation </b> and tutorials</em> will be provided to students throughout the semester. The instructor is open to use and refer any <i>online tutorials</i> whenever required.
        
        <!-- <em> or <i> tag makes the content emphasized or italic. It is used to see the contents with additional focus-->
        
        <!-- BlockQuote Element -->
        <blockquote>
            Online resources are not always validated. You have to check it first. And at the time of using it, you have to see the appearance of the contents by yourself.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h4>In-Class Notes and Codes<sup>&copy;</sup></h4>

            </dd>
            <dt>Missing Evaluation </dt>
