        <!-- Adding Image
To add an image in Html, we need to use <img> html tag. In that tag, we use src to provide the link of the image and width to define the view area of the image. we don't need to close image tag, like line break tag -->
        <img src="image1.jpg" width="100%">
        
        <!-- DIV Element-->
        <!-- Every web page has different contents to present, as well as it has different stuff to represent in different style. To do that, we need to divide the work space on a web page with div. Div helps us to seperate the contents of one web page in different sections/ parts -->
        <!-- To add/separate lines from one to another, we need to use line breaker, which is <br> tag. This tag, whenever you use, will add a new line to the content, will add a line breaker and will bring the following contents to the new line-->
        
    
        <h2>Enjoy Nature in Luxury </h2><!-- Highest Level Heading.. Main Section
            

Whenever you added a heading element, it will add line break to the contents and will bring the current cursor position to the new line section-->
