        <p>
        There are some valuable textbooks available for learning HTML. But a problem to those books is HTML changes very frequently. Once a new change is brought, the old book contents get obsolete. So, we always need to be updated by searching for new contents in Internet.

        <h4>Online Resources</h4>
            All the <span><em><b>class recordings<sup>1</sup>, required documentation </b> and tutorials</em></span> will be provided to students throughout the semester. The instructor is open to use and refer any <i>online tutorials</i> whenever required.
