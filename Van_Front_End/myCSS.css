If we are going to add CSS properties with HTML element, we need to call the element first and then we need to send the properties over there. We need to use Curly braces to set the scope of the css properties

            If same name element is used multiple times in a page, then if you call the element once, the CSS properties will be adapted for all of the places. That means, one html element based css will impact all othe same type of elements
            
            to apply individual CSS properties for each of the same-named-element seperately, we need to create CSS class. And then we need to pass that class along with CSS properties for that class to the targeted div to apply them properly. The same CSS class can be applied in different same named HTML elements
            
            to create a css class, we need to follow the following syntax
            
            .class_name{}
            
            this means, we first need to put a dot and then the class name followed by curly braces to define the scope.
